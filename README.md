Puzzles for Early Mornings
==========================

Morning All. Here are some rather easy problems for you to solve. The rules
are simple. Keep it functional. No mutable state, no for loops. That sort of
thing. And it is in [Scala](http://scala-lang.org), you may need to learn
this in a hurry. 

Get going by cloning this repo and installing the [Scala Build Tool](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)
on whatever passes for your compute facility. Run the test cases using `sbt test`. It may take
a few minutes to download all the libraries and the compiler. Have coffee. If you want to
see why some of us like Scala, use `sbt ~test` and watch the retest as you edit.

Good luck....
